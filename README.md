**PyEmbedBuilder** is a convenient, security-focused tool for creating completely portable, isolated, and distribution-ready Python environments on Windows. 

It automates the complex process of downloading embedded Python distributions, verifying their integrity, bootstrapping `pip`, installing dependencies, and securely extracting official components (like Tcl/Tk for Tkinter support) into a clean, portable folder structure.

## 🔒 Security & Integrity

Security is the core design principle of PyEmbedBuilder:

*   **Strict Verification:** All downloads from `python.org` are verified.
*   **HTTPS Only:** Enforced TLS for network operations.
*   **Audit Trail:** Generates a comprehensive `security_audit.log` for every build, recording source URLs.
*   **Path Sanitization:** Automatically strips absolute paths from `pip` metadata (`.dist-info`) to prevent and minimize local system information leakage when distributing portable apps with embedded environments.
*   **Zip-Slip Protection:** Validates all archive extractions against directory traversal attacks.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Wizard-Style Interface:** Modern, accessible Tkinter GUI with Dark/Light Mode, High Contrast Accessibility Mode and text scaling support.
*   **Full Python Support:** 
    *   Download any stable Python version (≥ 3.12.10).
    *   **Optional Component Extraction:** Automatically add `Scripts`, `tcl`, `Lib`, `libs`, and `include` folders—enabling full standard library support (including `tkinter`) in a portable embedded environment.
*   **Dependency Management:** Import your `requirements.txt` to pre-install packages into the portable environment.
*   **Portable Output:** 
    *   Generates `.bat` launchers automatically.
    *   Configures `._pth` files correctly for full isolation.
    *   Creates fully independent and portable Python environments in a `..\My Projects\` folder by default.
*   **Smart Caching:** Optional downloads cache to save bandwidth when creating multiple similar projects (by default builder auto-clears cache upon each successful build).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Download & Verify
Download the release archive and its signature:
*   `PyEmbedBuilder_(version).7z`
*   `PyEmbedBuilder_(version).7z.sha256`

**Verify the integrity (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Get-FileHash .\PyEmbedBuilder_(version).7z -Algorithm SHA256
# Compare output with the content of PyEmbedBuilder_(version).7z.sha256
```

### 2. Installation
PyEmbedBuilder is fully portable.  No installation is required. It has been successfully built with a running instance of itself.
The standalone portable version has been compressed with free 7-Zip software. To avoid any issues with .7z archives, I advise installing the free official 7-Zip software for Windows, available [here](https://7-zip.org/download.html).
1.  Extract `PyEmbedBuilder.7z` to a location of your choice (e.g., `C:\PyEmbedBuilder`).
2.  Navigate to the extracted folder.

### 3. Usage
Double-click **`launch_pyembed_builder.bat`** to start the application.

1.  **Create Project:** 
    *   Name your project.
    *   Select a Python version (Recommended or Custom).
    *   (Optional) Select a `requirements.txt` file.
    *   (Recommended) Check **"Add full stdlib..."** to include Tkinter, pip, and standard headers.
2.  **Review:** Check the build plan and security parameters.
3.  **Build:** Watch the automated process:
    *   Download & Verification
    *   Core Extraction
    *   Optional Components Extraction
    *   pip Bootstrap 
    *   Optional Packages Installation (requirements.txt)
    *   Paths Sanitization
4.  **Complete:** By default your portable environment is ready in `..\My Projects\<Project-Name>`.

## 📦 Output Structure

The builder creates self-contained environments structured for distribution:

```text
My Projects/
└── Project-Name/
    ├── launch.bat                 # Your App Launcher
    ├── (your_app_here).py         # Entry Point to Your Python Application
    ├── install_dependencies.bat   # Add new libraries/packages
    ├── list_dependencies.bat      # List all currently installed libraries/packages
    ├── uninstall_dependencies.bat # Remove any libraries/packages
    ├── requirements.txt           # List of recomended required libraries in the current Python project (provide your own when building)
    ├── build_manifest.json        # App manifest for debuging (remove it before public distribution)
    ├── python-embed/              # The portable Python environment
    │   ├── python.exe             # Python CLI Shell Binary
    │   ├── pythonw.exe            # Python Window Mode Shell Binary
    │   ├── Lib/                   # Standard library & site-packages
    │   ├── Scripts/               # Pip and other CLI tools
    │   └── ...
    └── ...
```

*Disclaimer: This is a very early working alpha version of the software. Always test and verify your portable Python apps before sharing them with others.*
